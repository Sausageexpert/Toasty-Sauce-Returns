Welcome back to another project, Expo components!

I've hired a new hitman, since the lynxes and the elks are busy posing to be on Wily the Library
He's Dracula. Great guy, really.

If you components have read Bram Stoker's original version, you should be terrified, but this Dracula
isn't that one. He's animated, and his name's Bob. Bob the Vampire, Blood-Sucking Bat

He doesn't eat much except evil components, so... yeah
